Learning Ajax from basics

## :diamond_shape_with_a_dot_inside: **Project's goal:**

In this project I will be creating from the very beginning<br> examples of vanilla js Ajax methods,
then combine it with php and will keep<br> adding more languages and their methods along the way.
inside each<br> file there will be comments at the top of each variable, method etc.

## :arrow_forward: **Usage**

<li> Install XAMPP, MAMP or whichever server application </li>
<li> clone the repo into your **htdocs** folder </li>
<li> open in your browser ``localhost/learning-ajax``</li>
<li> select which folder/file you would like to open and check</li>

## :warning: **NOTE:**

So far the ```.php``` files won't have much to display on browser<br>so you don't have to open them yet in browser
