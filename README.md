Learning Ajax from basics

## :diamond_shape_with_a_dot_inside: **Project's goal:**

In this project I will be creating from the very beginning examples of vanilla js Ajax methods,
then combine it with php and will keep adding more languages and their methods along the way.<br>
inside each file there will be comments at the top of each variable, method etc.
